Appearance things you can't change (&amp; shouldn't want to): you have such a sweet, expressive face. Beautifully even features fitting into a shape that gives you a very kind &amp; approachable look. 

Appearance things you can &amp; do change: with body dysmorphia, isn't it so important sometimes to find yourself in control of something, however seemingly small? Making your appearance better match your personality because, to you, your body isn't telling the truth. I think you've done a marvelous job of taking control where you are able. Your hair, glasses, &amp; medusa are a statement: you want adventure, you have a strong mind full of strong ideas, you will not be forced to conform but will make yourself a piece of art. You are not to be judged, but admired. By others, yes, but also by your own eyes.

All you need to do is message me a link to the toastee's post and your message/toast, then I'll comment on your behalf.

"Nice! Ive recently been getting Into modded Skyrim( special edition) I have around 150 mods , unfortunately for some weird reason my game won't load rn and it was working last night perfectly.  Thanks bethseda.  I also enjoy a good session of road redemption and I'll play some titanfall 1 here and there. I'm planning on playing a good amount of either modded oblivion or modded fall out 3 or modded fallout new Vegas.  I want to play another bethseda game.  I own : fall out 3, new Vegas, elder scrolls Morrowind, oblivion, Skyrim, special edition and online.  Ive really only played Skyrim and Skyrim special edition so I'll probably play one of the others soon.   I also have been putting off playing the dlc for the walking dead season one and buying season 2 so I'll probably do that soon. I also want to play life is strange again.

"It's actually more of a pinkish color IRL, but it's been a long, crunchy road to this light of hair lol I  used 30 minute bleach about twice, making sure to focus on my roots the second time (my hairs naturally dark brown) and then I used Wella Color Charm in cooling violet to tone it. That normally gets it a super light, almost silver color! I also use shimmer lights shampoo to pull out any yellow that's lingering. If you do decide to try it at home, definitely invest in some Olaplex! It's expensive (so you may just want to ask a hair stylist to use it when doing your hair), but it helps SO much. You use it during and after bleaching.

"My last bout of depression got me in a pretty bad self-hate spiral, too, but luckily I was able to learn a few really important truths I hope can be helpful to you (because they're true of you whether you feel it or not right now).

-You are brave &amp; strong for facing the trials that only you can know.
-You are worth the air you breath &amp; the space you fill.
-If you get out of bed today, you have won a battle. If you put on clean clothes, you've won another. Small steps still take you forward &amp; get you closer to wherever you're going. Don't underestimate the small things.
-It's hard to think positively, but try to give yourself little compliments to counter the negative thought spiral. Even if you don't totally believe it repeating good things like ""I'm pretty, I'm smart, sometimes I'm funny, etc."" can help you get out of the habit of constantly putting yourself down.

You look like someone with a good heart, kind &amp; intelligent. It's a hard battle feeling pain so deeply &amp; acutely at times, but the good thing is that when emotion runs deep, you get to experience the opposite too. Joy &amp; confidence will come your way again. Don't lose hope &amp; please don't be too hard on yourself.",,,,HBthePoet,,,1490769304,t5_39em5,t3_61yqjz,t3_61yqjz,2,1491875434,0,0,dfjsl7h,toastme,,,

"I'm the antipode of a perfectionist in most domains, and it has its pros and cons too, main pro being that I can be very relaxed about myself, main con being that I'm very sloppy. I can imagine very serious cons about perfectionism. I don't want to diminish them. But the pros can be amazing too. Ultimately, everyone is 100% themselves at the end of the day, and recognizing that and being ourselves through and through, no matter how we are, and appreciating our attributes is healthy. Not knowing what we're about or being in denial can be very dangerous. I'm glad you know what you're about and what the pros and cons are. Probably a sign of perfectionism, lol.

If you take any appreciation, optimism, or pride in your perfectionism, I hope it makes you feel good about yourself that it can resonate so clearly in just a simple picture of yourself. Maybe you don't see it that way. Personally, I find definitive personality traits something to treasure about ourselves, and if I had something that contributed to such visible beauty and elegance as you have, I hope I could even occasionally step outside of myself and see how capable of excellence I am.

Be proud of yourself!",,,,BiscuitTomoko,,,1490042181,t5_39em5,t3_60d7fy,t1_df6puvz,1,1491647788,0,0,df6rrxy,toastme,,,
