"You've got some good stuff there, music that belies your age! Believe it or not, music will take you very far in life, and will be there with you in both the darkest and brightest of times. I'm telling you this as someone with experience - music is one of the best and most effective methods of getting through some of the rough stuff life has to offer. There's a fantastic expression which says: ""Music is what emotions sound like"". Sometimes, if you're feeling down, listening to a sad song will remind you that you are never truly alone, because many people both before and after you have shared in your grief. Likewise, listening to a happy song when you're sad can be just the recipe to heal your weary soul. And then, once you come back to the light of goodness that shines in the world, and you will, that same upbeat music will only further fuel your joy. ������",,,,NonPrime,,,1487108847,t5_39em5,t3_5u0tlj,t1_ddqxg0a,3,1488847383,0,0,ddqzi8b,toastme,,,

Two small things, and I'm sort of new to this, so sorry if they're a bit unorthodox!

I really love how clean your living space looks. I'm not sure what you're going through, but I know when I'm in a downwards spiral that can be very hard to maintain.

Secondly, I really like how warm and open you look. I'm usually a really shy person at first, but you have such a welcoming and friendly look that I don't think I'd have any difficulty talking to you if I saw you on the street :)

Girls don't care as much for looks as we do. In the face department you're an 8.5 +  great bone structure, pretty eyes.

At the end of the day, any guy who's a 6 + gets to compete within the same category as guys who rank 6 to 10 in the looks dept.

Us guys have many other metrics we're judged upon by females: Character, drive, hobbies, profession, material possessions, fitness, humor, etc. etc.

TL;DR: You're 10/10 looks wise, don't worry about it even for a second. Contemplate the deeper aspects of you as a human being instead, that's how you'll fill that void that needs internet re-assurance.

Hey thanks. That's exactly what I do. I quit drinking quite a while ago.. 3 years now I think. I've had one or two drinks but for the most part stayed sober. I really need to get into exercise as I know how much my body craves it.  But I haven't been able to get into it,,,,mountainsnstuff,,,1486057507,t5_39em5,t3_5rjer5,t1_dd8cpzl,2,1488509356,0,0,dd8s1gf,toastme,,,

"I've got a friend like you. We actually met playing world of warcraft. Maybe it was easier for him to open up a little because he was safe behind a screen.  Turns out he lived in the next town over (Small world). I couldn't just leave that alone and I think curiosity finally got the best of him and so we met up for lunch. I don't think he made eye contact the first hour. lol I has just gone through a divorce at the time so we just started hanging out more. It was so great to have a friend to do things with or to call when I needed help. I think he was just happy not to be so alone anymore and although I enjoyed my ""me"" time I was too. Fast forward five years and we're still great friends to this day.  I have since married and he has a wonderful girlfriend. Our work lives keep us busy but we still meet up for lunch occasionally and chat when we need an ear. The point of this story...never label yourself at such an extreme that you begin to believe your own label. Maybe you're just extremely shy or introverted. Whatever the case, you are uniquely YOU and for every quirky personality trait you have, there is someone out there who doesn't give a damn and will like you just the same. If you haven't tried Warcraft, give it a go. I've made some amazing friendships through the game and well, it won't force you to leave the comfort and security of your home, but still gives you the opportunity to be social. If that's not your thing start hitting up a local park on the weekends. If you have a dog I find that this is a great way to meet people. Everyone always flocks to my dog when I take him places.

As for the issues you've mentioned, I can't fully relate to your situation but I'm going to offer advice anyway because I thrive on the feeling of believing I'm helping others. I have depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, and OCD which sucks. I'm open to talking about more details, but for the sake of not writing a novel I'll skip much of my life story for now. Important details include: when I was 13 I started feeling suicidal, when I was 16 I threw up in the ER all night because of a failed suicide attempt, I've been inpatient in psych hospitals on five separate occasions, and I've been trying various types of treatment and medications and stuff since then for the last three years and I still feel suicidal almost daily. It sucks.

I lied about offering advice. None is coming to me. It sounds like your life sucks right now, and I can relate to that. I'm here to listen and/or talk if you'd like. Sorry.",,,,coollegkid,,,1486808086,t5_39em5,t3_5tayms,t3_5tayms,10,1488756658,0,0,ddlxozi,toastme,,,

"I first separated them into square, somewhat even sections with the help of my sister. After it was sectioned out, I braided all of the sections so I could easily work with one section at a time. When I was ready to work on one section, I unbraided it and used a combo of the backcombing and twist and rip methods to dread them. It was a long process and honestly took a couple months to make it through all of the sections. 

I used a metal flea comb from a pet store to backcomb instead of a standard plastic comb. The teeth break easily so I recommend investing in a metal toothed comb. 

They're quite mature now so they look pretty awesome! But they were a frizzy mess at the beginning just like nearly all new dreadlocks. 

I recommend recruiting some patient friends and/or family members to help you with the process. The back sections of hair are difficult to work on by yourself.

dunno what is going on in the school, but imagine yourself 10 years later, most of the stuff will seem silly later. Also, you are doing your best right now, so do not worry if thing go wrong. 

Looking back at my tough time in school, I understand that the person I was, couldn't do anything different and have it easier. Struggles make you stronger and develop personality. 

 Feeling of loneliness stops, when you have someone to share your interests and dreams with. I have few friends, but loneliness doesn't leave entirely, if people do no see life the way you do and do not dream of similar stuff(my friends are quite different from me). Feeling lonely is okay, it means you have tons of people around, who are different from you. That means, each of them knows something you don't and you can learn from them. Also, when you can give something to others, be that help of present, you feel less lonely, you can try volunteering.",,,,bear_sees_the_car,,,1487044023,t5_39em5,t3_5sq87v,t3_5sq87v,1,1488827450,0,0,ddpuoph,toastme,,,

You have some of the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen, and your handwriting looks bloody amazing!

I know it can be really rough out there man. It might seem counterintuitive, but you might want to see about taking a break from the dating section, and try focusing on some other things that can help you feel better in the short term. Feeling better is definitely a series of small steps, and it can feel really shitty when you hit a bump, but it is just that.

"Imma give you the movie star speech from bojack horseman

“You are the star of a movie and this is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken, where the world tests you and people treat you like shit.  But it has to happen this way.  Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won’t feel as rewarding.  There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don’t matter.  Because this movie is not about them.  It’s never been about them.  All this time, the movie’s been about you.”
— 	Rutabaga Rabbitowitz, BoJack Horseman

Also all you need if you want to pick up girls is confidence without being a douche. You got the looks man.
